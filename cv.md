## About myself:
I studied in Minsk in gymnasium number 12. Instead of English, we learned Chinese. After the 9th grade, I entered the lyceum at BNTU. And then to the university for the specialty "software engineer". 2021 year I graduated from university and have been working at ViVo for 2020 year. I'm responsible for fixing phones. And I'm currently studying English at the Streamline.
