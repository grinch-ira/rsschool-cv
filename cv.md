## Code example:
              
Factorial KATA from CODEWARS: In mathematics, the factorial of a
non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all
positive integers less than or equal to n. For example: 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120. By convention the value of 0! is 1.

```
function factorial(n) 
{
    let result = 1;
while(n){
    result *= n--;
}
return result;
}
```
